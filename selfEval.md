# Self-Evaluation

1. This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- It was very challenging to say the least. I've learned and have had to absorb new concepts in a short amount of time. I'm proud of the progress that i have acomplished so far.


2. How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- I need to improve my workflow. I catch mysef sitting at my desk from 10:30 until 3 with no break because i can't fully grasp a new concept. I have been focusing on one assignment a day because it genuinely takes me a day to research, reread the mod 0 cirriculum that is given, and find youtube videos that explain the topic in a way i can understand. 


3. What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
- That its very important to keep a close eye on the code i'm typing out because it's extremely easy to make little errors that ruin the whole code.
